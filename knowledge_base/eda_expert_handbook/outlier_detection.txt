Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from other observations in a dataset. Detecting and analyzing outliers is important because they may represent data entry errors, measurement issues, or meaningful rare events.

Common outlier detection methods include:

Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:
Outliers are defined as values below Q1 − 1.5 × IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.

Z-Score Method:
Standardizes values based on mean and standard deviation. Observations with absolute Z-score greater than 3 are often considered outliers.

Visualization Methods:
Boxplots and scatter plots help visually identify extreme values.

Outliers should not always be removed. If they represent genuine phenomena, they may provide important insights. Analysts must evaluate context before deciding whether to retain or remove outliers.

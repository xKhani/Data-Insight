Correlation analysis measures the strength and direction of relationships between numerical variables. It helps identify patterns and dependencies that may inform predictive modeling or decision-making.

Pearson Correlation:
Measures linear relationship between two continuous variables. Values range from −1 to +1.

Interpretation:
+1 indicates perfect positive relationship
0 indicates no linear relationship
−1 indicates perfect negative relationship

General strength guidelines:
0.0–0.3 weak
0.3–0.7 moderate
0.7–1.0 strong

Spearman Correlation:
Used when data is not normally distributed or contains ordinal variables. Measures monotonic relationships.

Important Note:
Correlation does not imply causation. A strong correlation does not necessarily mean one variable causes changes in another.

Correlation matrices and heatmaps are commonly used to visualize relationships among multiple variables.

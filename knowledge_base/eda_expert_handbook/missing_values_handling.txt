Handling missing values is a fundamental step in exploratory data analysis. Missing data can occur due to data entry errors, system failures, or incomplete information collection.

Types of missing data include:

Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

Missing at Random (MAR)

Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

Common strategies for handling missing values include:

Deletion Methods:
Removing rows or columns with missing values when the proportion is small and does not significantly impact dataset integrity.

Imputation Methods:
Replacing missing values with statistical estimates such as mean, median, or mode. Median is preferred when data contains outliers or skewed distributions.

Advanced Imputation:
Using predictive models or interpolation techniques to estimate missing values based on other variables.

The choice of method depends on dataset size, proportion of missing data, and analytical objectives. Improper handling of missing values may introduce bias or reduce analytical accuracy.

A structured Exploratory Data Analysis workflow ensures consistency and reliability in analytical tasks. The recommended step-by-step workflow is as follows:

Step 1: Dataset Overview
Examine dataset dimensions including number of rows and columns. Identify column names and data types. Understand whether variables are numerical, categorical, or datetime.

Step 2: Data Quality Assessment
Check for missing values across all columns. Identify duplicate records. Verify data consistency and detect invalid entries.

Step 3: Summary Statistics
Generate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. These metrics provide initial insight into the distribution of numerical features.

Step 4: Missing Value Treatment
Determine whether missing values should be removed or imputed. Common strategies include mean, median, or mode imputation depending on data type and distribution.

Step 5: Distribution Analysis
Analyze distribution of numerical variables using histograms or density plots. Detect skewness, multimodality, or unusual spread.

Step 6: Outlier Detection
Identify extreme values using statistical techniques such as Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-score method. Evaluate whether outliers represent genuine variation or data errors.

Step 7: Correlation Analysis
Compute correlation between numerical variables to detect relationships. Strong correlations may indicate predictive relationships or redundancy.

Step 8: Visualization
Use appropriate visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to communicate patterns effectively.

Step 9: Insight Generation
Summarize findings, highlight key relationships, anomalies, and trends. Provide actionable insights based on observed patterns.

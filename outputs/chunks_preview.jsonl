{"id": "eda_overview.txt_0", "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical process in the data analysis pipeline used to understand the structure, quality, and characteristics of a dataset before applying advanced modeling or drawing conclusions. The purpose of EDA is to summarize main characteristics of the data, detect patterns, identify anomalies, test assumptions, and check relationships between variables.\n\nEDA allows analysts to gain insights into distributions, central tendencies, variability, and relationships among variables. It ensures that subsequent analysis or machine learning models are built on reliable and well-understood data.\n\nA standard EDA process includes:\n\nUnderstanding dataset structure (rows, columns, datatypes)\n\nDetecting missing values and inconsistencies\n\nIdentifying outliers and anomalies\n\nStudying distributions of variables\n\nExamining correlations and relationships\n\nVisualizing patterns using charts and graphs\n\nGenerating preliminary insights\n\nEDA is essential because incorrect or unclean data can lead to misleading conclusions.

The recommended step-by-step workflow is as follows:\n\nStep 1: Dataset Overview\nExamine dataset dimensions including number of rows and columns. Identify column names and data types. Understand whether variables are numerical, categorical, or datetime.\n\nStep 2: Data Quality Assessment\nCheck for missing values across all columns. Identify duplicate records. Verify data consistency and detect invalid entries.\n\nStep 3: Summary Statistics\nGenerate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. These metrics provide initial insight into the distribution of numerical features.\n\nStep 4: Missing Value Treatment\nDetermine whether missing values should be removed or imputed. Common strategies include mean, median, or mode imputation depending on data type and distribution.\n\nStep 5: Distribution Analysis\nAnalyze distribution of numerical variables using histograms or density plots. Detect skewness, multimodality, or unusual spread.", "metadata": {"doc_type": "eda_guideline", "topic": "workflow", "source": "eda_handbook"}}
